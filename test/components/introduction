My name is Navin Kumar Jha, and I’m from Madhubani, Bihar.
I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Patel College of Science and Technology.

I’m a full-stack developer with skills in both frontend and backend.
On the frontend, I work with React, Axios, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS.
On the backend, I use Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. I am also learning Java to expand my backend knowledge.

During college, I successfully organized an alumni meet, which helped me build leadership, planning, and event-management skills.

I have worked on HCMS and PMS, which are part of an ERP module, and I’m still improving and refining them.

As a fresher, I’m looking for a role where I can learn, grow, and contribute to the organization.
Regarding CTC, I’m flexible and open to discussing a fair package based on the role.
And yes, I’m open to relocation once the joining is confirmed. -->
